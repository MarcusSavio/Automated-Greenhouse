Title 2: "Autonomous Greenhouse Control System Using AI and Robotics"

Abstract:
This project proposes an Autonomous Greenhouse Control System that combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms with robotics for efficient and automated greenhouse management.
The system will integrate sensors to monitor environmental factors like temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture. 
AI algorithms will analyze sensor data to regulate conditions inside the greenhouse autonomously, controlling parameters such as irrigation, ventilation, and shading.
Robotics components will be employed for tasks such as plant monitoring, harvesting, and maintenance. 
The project aims to enhance crop yield, reduce resource consumption, and enable sustainable agriculture practices by leveraging advanced technologies for greenhouse control and management.
